title: CurrentTiddler
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The current tiddler provides an ever-changing context or background against which several features of WikiText are interpreted.

For example, `{{!!title}}` denotes the value of the ''title'' field of whatever the current tiddler happens to be. This technique can be used in a [[TemplateTiddler|TemplateTiddlers]] to keep the template generic.

The title of the current tiddler can always be found in the [[currentTiddler variable|WidgetVariable: currentTiddler]].

The current tiddler is set in several ways, including by the ListWidget and the TiddlerWidget.
