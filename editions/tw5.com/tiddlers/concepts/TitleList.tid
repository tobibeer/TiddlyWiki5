title: TitleList

A title list is a line of text that presents one or more tiddler titles, strung together with a space between each one and the next.

If a title //contains// a space, it needs double square brackets around it.

Example:

`GettingStarted [[Discover TiddlyWiki]] Upgrading`

Title lists are used in various places, including PermaLinks and the ListField.
