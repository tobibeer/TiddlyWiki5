Use ''bold'' when referring to:

* Captions in ~TiddlyWiki's user interface:
** "the ''Recent'' tab", "the ''Hide sidebar'' button"
* Tiddler fields:
** "the ''list'' field"
* Example tiddlers and tags:
** "create a tiddler called ''Super Soup Recipe'' with the tag ''cookery''"

''Bold'' is also used to make part or all of a sentence stand out from the rest of the tiddler.

Use //italics// to give more subtle emphasis to a word or phrase.

Use `monospaced` text when a sentence contains a fragment of ~WikiText or a string that the user could type.

Use the double quotation mark `"` as the basic one. It is easier to read on screen, and it avoids confusion with the apostrophe. To keep things clean and simple, quotation marks and apostrophes should be straight `'`, not curly `’`, and the ellipsis should be three separate dots `...` rather than `…`

Avoid using a single hyphen `-` as sentence punctuation. Instead, use a double hyphen -- which ~TiddlyWiki renders as an en-dash -- with a space on either side.

Items in lists and tables should only end with a full stop (period in US English) if they are complete sentences. They should have no trailing punctuation otherwise.

It is very rarely necessary to use an exclamation mark in professional documentation.
