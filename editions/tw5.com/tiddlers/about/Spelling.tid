Because ~TiddlyWiki is of British origin, its English documentation uses [[British spelling in preference to US spelling|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences]].

Words like "customise" are spelled "-ise", not "-ize".

Standard technical acronyms are written in upper case, without dots: `HTML`, not `html` or `H.T.M.L.`

Avoid arbitrarily abbreviating words and sentences. But the following abbreviations are acceptable:

|!Abbreviation |!Meaning |!Notes |
|e.g. |for example |with a dot after each letter |
|i.e. |that is to say |with a dot after each letter |
|etc |and so on |without a dot |
